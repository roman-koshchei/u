# Getting started

At this point Unator isn't planned to be published as a library in NuGet.
So basically whenever you want to use certaian module/feaute you just copy file,
that contains this feature from GitHub.

In the docs for each module/feature you will find links to files in the GitHub
repository to copy.

## .NET 8

I am using .NET 8 because I want to explore new version. Surely a lot of the
code can be compatible with .NET 6 and earlier.
If you can't migrate to a newer version than just make couple of twicks and
code will work.

You own the code, so it's on you.
