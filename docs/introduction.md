# Introduction

Unator is a set of rebust minimalistic libraries,
that can be used seperately from each other.

C# stays popular choise and surely will be in the future.
But unfortunately C# lacks feauters that modern languages provide.

- Rich type system: Rust and Typescript pushing it
- Compile time execution: Rust and Zig are best in it
- Result/Optional: V, Zig, Rust and many others
- ...

After working with C# for 3 years I quite enjoyed the language.
Rich standard library is cool. And I will continue working with C# at
least in university, but I expect use it for work as well.

So Unator contains utilities which may bring alternatives for feauters above,
as well as usefull components that I reuse across different projects.
